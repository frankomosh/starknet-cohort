What is Starkware, and what has been its key innovations in the blockchain industry?
StarkWare is a leading company in the development of scalable and secure blockchain solutions. The companyâ€™s STARK proof system has the potential to revolutionize the blockchain industry by enabling significantly higher throughput and lower costs.
How does StarkEx leverage STARK proofs to ensure the validity of large batches of transactions off-chain with a minimal on-chain footprint?
The off-chain Prover processes large batches of transactions and generates a STARK proof. The on-chain Verifier checks STARK proof in a few computational steps. Massive scaling off-chain is enabled, where large computations is processed, whose integrity is then enforced on-chain with minimal computations.
