# How does StarkEx leverage STARK proofs to ensure the validity of large batches of transactions off-chain with a minimal on-chain footprint?


The off-chain Prover processes large batches of transactions and generates a STARK proof. The on-chain Verifier checks STARK proof in a few computational steps. Massive scaling off-chain is enabled, where large computations is processed, whose integrity is then enforced on-chain with minimal computations.
