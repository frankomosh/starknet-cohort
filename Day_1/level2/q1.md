# What is Cairo designed for, and what makes its processor unique?

Cairo is designed for creating STARK-provable programs for general computation. Cairo therefore powers Starknet and StarkEx, scaling applications on Mainnet, including dYdX, Sorare, ImmutableX, and more. Cairo allows developers to write Starknet smart contracts in a safe and convenient manner.
