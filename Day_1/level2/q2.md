# How does Cairo's virtual CPU handle cryptographic constraints, and what advantage does this offer?

Cairo has a cryptographic proof systems for computational integrity are protocols that can address security issues by: Introducing zero-knowledge for privacy and enabling succinct verification that is exponentially more efficient than re-execution.
